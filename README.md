- Hey, I'm Arjun a budding coding enthusiast from VIT Vellore
- I'm really interested in the realm of data security and cryptography
- I'm currently working on improving my base knowledge of languages based on my college curriculum (Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, C++ etc)
- I'd like to work on projects that would let me learn the basics of cryptography and the like, to improve my knowledge of the subject 
- Besides sitting in front of a computer for work, I love playing games (Sable, Skyrim and Fallout 3 for now), reading books (Sutture currently) and rock
- Life is fun!
